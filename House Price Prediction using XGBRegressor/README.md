# House Price Prediction using XGBRegressor

This project demonstrates how to use the XGBoost library to predict house prices based on various features. The model is trained using the XGBRegressor, a popular gradient boosting algorithm.

## Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Preparation**: The input data includes various features such as average number of rooms per dwelling, proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940, and more. Before training the model, the input data needs to be preprocessed to ensure it's in a suitable format.

2. **Model Training**: The XGBRegressor model is trained using the preprocessed data. The model learns patterns from the input data and optimizes its parameters to minimize prediction errors.

3. **Making Predictions**: Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data. Given a set of input features for a house, the model predicts the corresponding house price.
