# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes. The project utilizes a dataset consisting of various health-related features such as glucose level, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI), along with the target variable indicating whether the individual is diabetic or not.

## Summary

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for preventing complications and improving quality of life. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on relevant health indicators.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure. Features and target variable are separated, and data standardization is performed to ensure uniformity.

2. **Model Training:** A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel is trained on the dataset. The classifier learns patterns from the provided health-related features to predict diabetes.

3. **Model Evaluation:** The accuracy of the trained model is evaluated using both training and testing datasets. This helps assess the model's performance and generalization ability.

4. **Making Predictions:** After training, the model can be utilized to make predictions on new data. Relevant health indicators are provided as input, and the model predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on these inputs.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various health-related features and a target variable indicating whether the individual is diabetic or not. It allows the model to learn from historical data and make predictions on unseen instances.
